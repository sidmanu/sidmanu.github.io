# Hello, World! 

Well - it all starts from that iconic phrase. All our coding journeys - back in the day in Basic, C++, Java and now in Python or some other cool language. Pretty much, the first Ma, Mum mum, Dada phrase in the real world for a kid! 

We all start somewhere. Not worried about how far ahead others are, whose journeys are nearing completion and whose journeys have ended already. Our journey is our own. It's not about the speed, it's not about copying the path others have taken. Often, the biggest challenge is to feel good about the pace, the direction, the destination and the path we choose. To be our own true, real selves! Often as well, it's about copying or imitating, at least in the beginning, till we discover our authentic selves. 

It's all alright - as long as we keep forging ahead. Sometimes slowly, sometimes fast, sometimes even stuck but trying to move. It's all good! I hope you'll start somewhere :)
